# Project Todos
The project for week 14 was to create a Todo-app to practice writing our own reducers and actions in Redux.

## The problem
I started the project with making a skiss over what features I wanted and how I wanted it to look. 
Being the second week of Redux I looked at a lot of videos to get a better understanding of the fundamentals and had a lot of tries and errors coding.  

In the end my app have three buttons, which I created to better understand the relationship between reducers and actions. In the future I would like to add a filter to my app, so it can be seen in three categories and then implement the buttons in a more sutable way.
